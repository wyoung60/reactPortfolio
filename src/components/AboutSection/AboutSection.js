          My name is Wesley Young. I am based in Castle Rock, Colorado. I have
          bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Western Michigan
          University and am currently enrolled in a full stack web development
          bootcamp at Denver University. I am a problem solver and love to solve
          puzzles. During my journey to become an engineer, I found a passion
          for creating and troubleshooting code.
